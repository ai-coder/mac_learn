*** READ THIS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING/USING THIS MODULE ***

'mac_learn' is a library used to implement the algorithms of Machine Learning with user defined algorithms as well as modules like scikit-learn. This repo is for beginners who are looking forward to implemeant Machine Learning algorithms using Python.

Apart from using this module the main use of this module is to study the algorithms and working of the Machine Learning algorithms. Till now this module will complete all the algorithms discussed in the Coursera course of Andrew Ng.

========================================================================================

***HOW TO USE***

1. You can see the implementation of algorithms in the 'driver.py' file
2. The codes of the implementation can be studied in the algorithms folder.
3. File containing the fucntions of Machine Learning and Plotting the data are separate.
4. The datas folder consists of the data we use to check the algorithms.

========================================================================================

DriverX.py are the files which shows implementations of various algorithms. The algorithms used and their corresponding driver files are - 

	1. driver.py	:	Linear Regression
	2. driver1.py	:	Logistic Regression	(WIP)
	3. driver2.py	:	Multiclass Classification
	4. driver3.py	:	Neural Networks	(WIP)

WIP- Work in Progress

========================================================================================

The logistic regression algorithm is in development. We need to use minimize in the provided format of X, y, theta. Custom cost function should be coded in the code file.
